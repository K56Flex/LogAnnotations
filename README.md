# LogAnnotations
An annotation for writting log in runtime,may be useful to read other's source code.

We always have to read other's code,or we could deal some very old code in our project,we don't know which code really work ,other not.To achive that,we will usually have to write some logs to figure out whick code is really working,but it is a tedious job...            

So I create LogAnnotations to help we write logs!                       

The project is under developing.
